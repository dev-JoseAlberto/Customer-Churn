#Customer Churn
A churn is when a customer stops paying or subscribing to your products or  services.
In other word, is the loss these customers.

Customer churn is one of the most important business metrics.

Thatâ€™s because the cost of retaining an existing customer is significantly less than the cost of acquiring a new one.

The latter is often referred to as Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).

Companies use it as a metric to track if a company has a viable business model that can keep profits generating while maintaining a low CAC.
